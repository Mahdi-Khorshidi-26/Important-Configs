1- for testing porpuses we need to have to create our apps with create-react-app 
which has all the dependencies installed on it and it can stop us from searching for 
the configuration part in vite but will cover that after all the explanation at the end of this file : 

2- every test has three steps Called threaple "A":

A : Arrange

A : Act

A : Asserion

3- we need to import somefiles for every test that are : 
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import user from '@testing-library/user-event'
import Form from './Form'; // this can be the acuall component that we want to write the test on 
test("this is to see that is we have two inputs and a button in the document", () => {
  //Arrange
  render(<Form />);
  //Act
  const inputs = screen.getAllByRole("textbox");
  const button = screen.getByRole("button");
  //Assertion
  expect(inputs).toHaveLength(2);
  expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
});
