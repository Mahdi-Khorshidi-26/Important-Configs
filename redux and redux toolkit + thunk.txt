0- installation : npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit

1- the first thing is how to use it with creating store and 
passing it to Provider Component that wraps everything 

1/5 - createSlice({
    name:"",
    initialState:{},
    reducers:{
        functionName(state,action){
            in here we can use mutation because redux uses IMMER in the background
        }
    }
})

2- then we have createConfig which we can pass our Slices to it and then we should return that 
as the store and returning all the slices Actions as well

3-also we can use custom actions for creating and using them for thunks :

const name =() => {
    return async (dispatch)=>{
         const nameFetching = async ()=>{
            do the fetching and return the data how ever you like ;
         }   

    try{
        const data = await nameFetching()
        dispatch(do the data setting)
    }catch(err){
        dispatch(do the error Handling)    
    }finally{
        // gets done anyway
    }

    }
}
