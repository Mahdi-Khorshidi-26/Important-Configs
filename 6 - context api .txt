- what are the advantages to use context api 
- in a folder called store usually create your file and name it what ever you want 
- export nameofthecontext with a captalized letter then we go to the file that we have all the components loaded 
- then we import that and wrappe all the components that use the state with a <nameofthecontext.Provider></nameofthecontext.provider>
- then it has a value that we should pass all the values that we have pass in there to work and then autocompletion will work too 
- we can now pass our values in the value of <nameofthecontext.Provider   value={}></nameofthecontext.provider>
- to provide and have accsses all the properties we can import the context that we created and import useContext then
pass the context to useContext and now we have access to all the properties that have been created so far anywhere we want
