1- npm i -D vitest

2-package.json ==> scripts==> add a script like below :
"test": "vitest --environment jsdom",

3-package.json ==> scripts==> add a script like below :
"test:ui": "vitest --ui --environment jsdom"

4- when we run the test above it asks us to install the vitest:ui library

5- npm i @testing-library/react

6- npm i jsdom

7- now it's time to say our vitest to use jsdom by some configuration
in the root folder create a file called vitest.config.jsx

these lines of codes should be in there : 
/* eslint-disable react-refresh/only-export-components */
import defineConfig from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: "jsdom",
  },
});

then restart the vitest to set the configuration;


8- the last library that we need to be installed :
npm i @testing-library/jest-dom
